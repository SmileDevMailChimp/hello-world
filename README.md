# hello-world
This is my start into becoming a epic test engineer. All resources and information I find along my journey will be stored here. 
I am ready to learn more about MailChimp and their products. How do they enhance users experience and what I can do to help enhance the Product team.  I am ready to learn everything that is being taught to me. I will work diligently to update my knowledge of coding and scripting in order to be a great test engineer.
